# Decoding Arctic Monkeys

I have been watching album reviews recently and one reviewer mentioned that the length of tracks on Arctic Monkeys third record called Humbug is pretty generous (e.g. 5:44 in the case of The Jeweller's Hands or 4:44 in Dance Little Liar).

Considering the fact that a typical "radio hit" is usually no more than 3 and a half minutes, this got me thinking if there is some pattern to the length of tracks by Arctic Monkeys as I remember that the songs featured of their debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not were much shorter. And by the way, I'm a big Arctic Monkeys fan...
