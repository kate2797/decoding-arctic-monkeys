# Decoding Arctic Monkeys

## General Information

Though not all pop songs sound alike, many share a common trait: their length. As [Ben McKinney](https://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/6003271/why-are-songs-3-minutes-long) notes, most hover around the same duration. It's an unwritten rule in the industry that pop tunes should clock in at no longer than three minutes. Why? Because this length is incredibly radio-friendly. 

While YouTube music reviewer Brad Taste in Music has pointed out the generous track lengths on Arctic Monkeys' third record, 'Humbug,' such as 'The Jeweller's Hands' at 5:44 or 'Dance Little Liar' at 4:44, their debut album, 'Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not,' featured much shorter songs, typically ranging from 2:21 to 3:15 minutes. But did Arctic Monkeys, after their explosive debut success, cease to produce radio hits?
