# Decoding Arctic Monkeys

“All pop songs may not sound the same, but most are close to the same length.” – [Ben McKinney](https://www.vox.com/2014/8/18/6003271/why-are-songs-3-minutes-long) 

It is an unwritten rule that pop songs should be no longer than 3 minutes. Why? The length of 3 minutes very radio-friendly. 

While a popular YouTube music reviewer known as [Brad Taste in Music](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChwbfG8UvnLOJ_WgRiAaPBA) pointed out that the length of tracks on Arctic Monkeys third record Humbug is quite generous (e.g., 5:44 in the case of The Jeweller's Hands or 4:44 in Dance Little Liar), the songs featured of their debut album Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm No were much shorter. We are mostly talking 2:21 to 3:15 minutes. 

Did Arctic Monkeys, after taking Britain by storm with their debut, stop making radio hits?
